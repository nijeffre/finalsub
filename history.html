      <p>The Creation of cheesecake baked on an earthenware griddle before being enjoyed by the masses. Back then, cheesecake was considered a great source of energy and there is evidence showing it was served to athletes during the first Olympic Games in 776 BC. Cheesecake was also popular as a wedding dessert!</p>

        <h3>1390</h3>
        <p> The first English cookbook, The Forme of Cury (c. 1390), consisting of a collection of medieval English recipes compiled by the cooks of King Richard II, included two cheese tarts: “Sambocade,” containing curd cheese, egg whites, rosewater, and elder flowers, and “Tart de Bry” (the word bry was derived from Old Norman for “pounded,” referring to the method of preparing the cheese) made with ruayn (a semi-soft autumn cows’ cheese), egg yolks, and ground ginger. For the ensuing five centuries, almost every subsequent English cookbook contained at least one cheesecake recipe.</p>

    <h3>18th Century</h3>
    <p>folks begin to remove yeast from recipes, making the cake more fitting as a sweet dessert.

      Cream cheese (which was the accidental result of a failed attempt to replicate the French cheese Neufchatel) did not find its place in a cheesecake recipe until the dessert reached the US</p>

  <h3>1900s</h3>
  <p> Arnold Reuben is generally credited for creating the New York Style cheesecake. Reuben was born in Germany and he came to America when he was young. The story goes that Reuben was invited to a dinner party where the hostess served a cheese pie. Allegedly, he was so intrigued by this dish that he experimented with the recipe until he came up with the beloved NY Style cheesecake.</p>
