      <h3>Spain</h3>
      <p>Known simply as tarta de queso or gazta tarta in its native Basque, this simple yet incredibly creamy cheesecake variation is a decades-old local specialty of the La Viña Bar in San Sebastián. The recipe is a simple combination of classic cheesecake ingredients such as sugar, heavy cream, eggs, and cream cheese, but unlike its more popular counterparts, this Basque version does not have any crust.</p>

<h3>Chicago</h3>
<p>Schulman was not the only Chicago restaurateur serving cheesecake when he endeavored to perfect the recipe at his 1966 steakhouse. He was, however, committed to creating the city’s fluffiest recipe, which he debuted at the inaugural Taste of Chicago in 1980. His success, and his cheesecake’s popularity, eventually led to the establishment of his dessert emporium, which churns out some 20,000 baked goods daily.</p>

<h3>German</h3>
The history of German cheesecake is murky, as käsekuchen is an example of a European fresh-cheese dessert recipe that developed over the ages. It’s been around since at least the 1600s, and Austrians eat a similar cake known as topfenkuchen.

        Rather than cream cheese, käsekuchen filling is made with quark, which is a fresh, unripened cheese with a small curd, plus eggs, milk, and sugar. It’s traditionally baked in a dough crust, though shortbread crust is not uncommon. Another variation, käsekuchen torte, incorporates cream and gelatin to set in lieu of being baked. Berries or other fruit may be added to the filling.</p>
